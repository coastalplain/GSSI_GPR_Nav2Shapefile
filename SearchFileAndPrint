## PURPOSE
##    find all GSSI-formatted Navigation files and print the first two lines of each.
##    somewhere on my hard drives there is one that is not correct, and I can't test for it, so I'm recursively searching

# FIND A PLACE TO START
parent.folder <- choose.dir(getwd(), "Choose a suitable folder")
setwd(parent.folder)

# MAKE A LIST OF ALL FILES WITHIN AND BENEATH THE START PLACE
fileList.full <- dir(pattern="_POS.CSV$", recursive = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE, include.dirs=TRUE)
fileCount <- NROW(fileList.full)  #how many files will need to be processed, use as counter
startTime <- format(Sys.time(), format="%Y%m%d%H%M%S")
fileList <- vector()
